# Â¡Ven a Comer! - Made in Mexico

Hi, my name is Rob and this is my Data Centric Development Milestone Project.

I am a bit fan of cooking, and seeing as my wife is from Mexico I decided to base this project on Mexican traditional recipes and cookng. I based this project on the site [Mexican Please](https://www.mexicanplease.com/).

These is so much I wanted to do in this project but due to time constraints with work and home I was unfortunatley unable to complete this project. I will however after finishing up this course I will come back and finish this project as I have become such of developing websites as like cooking and art it is very creative and fun.
